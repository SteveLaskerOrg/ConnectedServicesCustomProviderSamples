Connected Services Samples
======================================

This repository contains everything you need to get started building a Connected Services extension.

The respository is made up of 3 top-level directories:

* **docs**.  Contains a [walk-through] to get you started building your own extension
  and [API documentation] to explain what extensibility points are available.

* **Externals**.  Contains the latest Connected Services binaries that you can reference, and the
  latest VSIX installers for both the Connected Services core and the Salesforce extension.

* **src**.  Contains two sample extensions: Grid and Wizard.  You can use these to jumpstart your
  development, or as a reference.

To get started, ensure you have [Visual Studio 2015 Preview] and the [Visual Studio 2015 SDK] installed.  Also, ensure you have
installed the [latest Connected Services VSIX]**.  From there, you can start by reading the walk-through document to get
started building your extension.
